## Description

Our most robust cherrypicking protocol. Specify aspiration height, labware, pipette, as well as source and destination wells with this all inclusive cherrypicking protocol.

Explanation of complex parameters below:

* `input .csv file`: Here, you should upload a .csv file formatted in the [following way](https://opentrons-protocol-library-website.s3.amazonaws.com/custom-README-images/0e696e/example.csv), making sure to include headers in your csv file. Refer to our [Labware Library](https://labware.opentrons.com/?category=wellPlate) to copy API names for labware to include in the `Source Labware` column of the .csv.
* `Pipette Model`: Select which pipette you will use for this protocol.
* `Pipette Mount`: Specify which mount your single-channel pipette is on (left or right)
* `Tip Type`: Specify whether you want to use filter tips.
* `Tip Usage Strategy`: Specify whether you'd like to use a new tip for each transfer, or keep the same tip throughout the protocol.

### Protocol Steps
1. Pipette will aspirate a user-specified volume at the designated labware and well according to the imported csv file. Slot is also specified, as well as aspiration height from the bottom of the well.
2. Pipette will dispense this volume into the final PCR plate on slot 11.
3. Steps 1 and 2 are repeated for each line of the .csv file
4. Pipette will aspirate a user-specified volume of primer and dispense to each destination well in the final PCR plate.

### Process
1. Input your protocol parameters above.
2. Download your protocol and unzip if needed.
3. Upload your custom labware to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) by navigating to `More` > `Custom Labware` > `Add Labware`, and selecting your labware files (.json extensions) if needed.
4. Upload your protocol file (.py extension) to the [OT App](https://opentrons.com/ot-app) in the `Protocol` tab.
5. Set up your deck according to the deck map.
6. Calibrate your labware, tiprack and pipette using the OT App. For calibration tips, check out our [support articles](https://support.opentrons.com/en/collections/1559720-guide-for-getting-started-with-the-ot-2).
7. Hit 'Run'.
